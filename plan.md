## How will the evolution work?

Start off simple:

The world is populated with food.
Organisms need to get food, and they do this by swimming over to the food and getting on top of it.
If an organism doesn't eat enough food, it dies.
If it eats too much food, it dies.

Organisms have different traits. These are generated randomly initially, but from then on are passed down in generations by mating organisms.
Only one trait of any specific type can be passed down when mating (so only 1 speed trait can be passed down, for example).
